Otherwise, the way in how are implemented can influence in the possitive or negative way, because in out tests, we can percibe that apply lemmas only for verbs, has as consequence that the pearson´s cosrrelation value decresee, nevertheles, the better way, it was applied for all the possible options.\n","\n","  * Do you think that could perform better for any pair of texts?\n","    - As it was observed exist a possible inprovment for the lemma implementation and it is by another library that take into account many gramaticals, morphology factor.
