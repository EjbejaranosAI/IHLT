Data\n","\n","2. What we are doing?\n","#### Techniques for preprocessing text for similarity comparison\n","\n","- Stemming: is a process that involves reducing words to their base form, or stem, in order to normalize the text and remove variations in word endings. For example, the words \"running,\" \"runs,\" and \"ran\" would all be reduced to the stem \"run\" by a stemming algorithm.\n","\n","\n","- Lemmatization: is a process that involves reducing words to their base form, or lemma, in order to normalize the text and remove variations in word endings. Unlike stemming, lemmatization takes into account the context of the word in order to determine its lemma, resulting in more accurate and meaningful reductions. For example, the words \"running,\" \"runs,\" and \"ran\" would all be reduced to the lemma \"run\" by a lemmatization algorithm.\n","\n","- Tf-idf weighting: Is a method for assigning a weight to each word in a document based on its relative importance. The weight is calculated by multiplying the term frequency (tf) of the word by the inverse document frequency (idf) of the word across all documents in a corpus. This weighting scheme gives higher weight to words that are more frequent within a document but less frequent across the corpus, making them more important for characterizing the document.\n","\n","- NES : Function used the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) to identify named entities in a given sentence. The sentence parameter is the sentence in which named entities should be identified, and the binary parameter determines whether named entities should be grouped together or returned as individual tokens. The function returns a set of the named entities and individual words found in the sentence.\n","\n","\n","These techniques can be used in combination with each other or with stopwords removal to preprocess text and improve the accuracy of similarity comparison. For example, you could use stemming or lemmatization to normalize the words in the phrases, and then use tf-idf weighting to assign importance to each word based on its frequency within the phrases and across a larger corpus. This would allow you to compare the similarity of the phrases in a more meaningful and accurate way\n","\n","\n","3.
